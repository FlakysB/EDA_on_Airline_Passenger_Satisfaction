# EDA_on_Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction

## Project Overview

This analysis is conducted to evaluate passenger satisfaction based on feedback surveys. The primary goal is to understand passengers' 
level of satisfaction and identify areas where improvements can be made to enhance passengers' comfort, increase patronage, and generate more revenue for the airline.

## Insights

Upon analyzing the survey data, several key insights were obtained:

 **Unsatisfied Passengers**: The analysis revealed that the percentage of unsatisfied passengers is higher than that of satisfied passengers. This indicates a potential issue with the overall quality of service.

 **First-Time Passengers**: It was observed that a significant portion of the passengers were first-time travelers. This might contribute to the lower satisfaction levels, as first-time travelers may have higher expectations or be less familiar with the airline's services.

**Low Percentage of Returning Passengers**: The data indicates that only 18.31% of passengers are returning customers. This could be attributed to the dissatisfaction with the services provided during previous trips.

## Recommendations

To address the issues identified in the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

**Improve Service Quality**: Focus on enhancing the quality of services across all aspects of the passenger experience, including in-flight services, online booking, check-in, cleanliness, and online boarding.

**First-Time Passenger Engagement**: Implement strategies to educate and engage first-time passengers better. This could include providing clear information about the airline's services, amenities, and what to expect during the journey.

 **Feedback Loop**: Establish a robust feedback system that encourages passengers to provide feedback after their journeys. This will help in continuously monitoring and improving service quality based on passenger input.

**Loyalty Programs**: Introduce loyalty programs or incentives for returning passengers to encourage repeat business. These programs could offer discounts, upgrades, or other perks to loyal customers.

**Employee Training**: Invest in training and development programs for airline staff to ensure they provide excellent customer service consistently.

**Marketing and Communication**: Improve communication with passengers through marketing efforts. Highlight the airline's strengths, improvements made based on feedback, and the value of choosing the airline for their travel needs.

 **Cleanliness and Hygiene**: Pay special attention to cleanliness and hygiene standards both on the ground and during flights. Passengers place a high value on cleanliness, especially in light of health concerns.

**In-Flight WiFi**: Enhance the in-flight WiFi service or consider providing it for free to improve the overall in-flight experience.

 **Online Booking**: Streamline and simplify the online booking process to make it more user-friendly and efficient for passengers.

 **Check-In Service**: Improve the check-in process, whether it's at the airport or online, to reduce waiting times and make it more convenient for passengers.

**Online Boarding**: Implement user-friendly online boarding procedures to expedite the boarding process and reduce passenger stress.

By implementing these recommendations, the airline can work towards improving passenger satisfaction, increasing customer loyalty, and ultimately boosting revenue. 
Regularly reviewing and adapting these strategies based on ongoing feedback and data analysis will be essential to long-term success.
